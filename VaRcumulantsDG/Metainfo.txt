Name of QuantLet: 	VaRcumulantsDG 

Published in:		Applied Quantitative Finance

Description:		'Computes the first n cumulants for the class of quadratic forms of Gaussian vectors. Notes: This function does not need the initial diagonalization. If the diagonalization has been done already, use VaRcumulantDG, which is faster.'

Keywords:		'Delta-Gamma-models, cumulant, gaussian, diagonalization, function'

Usage:			r = VaRcumulantsDG(n,l)

Input:  '-n: scalar, highest order of cumulants to be computed
-l: a list defining the distribution contains at least the following components: 
 - theta: the constant term 
 - Delta: the linear term (the first derivative) 
 - Gamma: the quadratic term (the Hessian matrix) 
 - Sigma: the covariance matrix'


Output:		'- rn : (rn x 1) vector of the first n cumulants'

Example: 'theta = 0
 Delta = c(1)
 Gamma = diag(rep(1,1))
 Sigma = diag(rep(1,1))
 par = list()
 par$theta = theta
 par$Delta = Delta
 par$Gamma = Gamma
 par$Sigma = Sigma
 VaRcumulantsDG(4,par)


Result: Contents of r
 [1,] 0.5 
 [2,] 1.5 
 [3,] 4 
 [4,] 15 '
