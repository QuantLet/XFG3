Published in: Applied Quantitative Finance (3rd Edition)

Description: 'Performs quantile LASSO regression in a moving window by using BIC 
and GACV criteria to choose penalty parameter (lambda). The input data are daily 
logarithmic stock returns of 200 largest U.S. financial companies and 6 macro variables. 
Each of the selected companies is taken as a dependent variable and is regressed by means 
of linear quantile regression with L1-penalty term on the remaining ones together with 
the macro variables. Plots time series of lambda in quantile LASSO regression. 
Furthermore, the cardinality of the active set q, the L2-norm of the residuals 
and the L1-norm of the parameter beta are plotted. All of the plots contain results 
from a number of regressions (equal to number of selected companies) and the average 
over all of them. Writes resulting time series of average lambda chosen by BIC 
and GACV into a .csv file'
