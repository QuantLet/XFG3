Usage: XFGqDGtest(n,N,dt)

Input: 'n- number of samples to use in the plot
N- modulus of the FFT to use in the approximation, should be a power of 2
dt- the size of the grid in the approximation of the Fourier inversion integral'

Output: '- plots the 1%-quantile from the two one-parametric sub-families of the class of quadratic forms of Gaussian vectors, as defined by the functions XFGdg11par and XFGdg12par'
