Usage:

- 'r = gFourierInversion(N,K,dt,t0,x0,charf,l)'

Input:
- N: 'scalar, the modulus of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) used; should be a power of 2.'
- K: 'scalar, the number of evaluations of the characteristic function; K has to be smaller or equal to N; when K < N, the input vector is filled with zeros up to N.'
- dt: 'scalar, the grid-size in t used for the approximation of the inversion integral'
- t0: 'scalar, indicating whether the t-grid includes t = 0 (t0==0) or t = dt/2 (otherwise)'
- x0: 'scalar, the starting point of the x-grid'
- charf: 'string, the name of the characteristic function'
- l: 'list, containing l$mu (the expectation) and l$sigma (the standard deviation) of the characteristic function (charf).'

Output:
- rn: '(rn x 1) - vector containing the density values on the x-grid. The grid is given by x_j = x_0 + j dx, dx = 2 pi/(N dt)'

Example: 'Approximates the standard normal density and plots it.

mu = 0 
sigma = 1 
par = list(mu=mu,sigma=sigma) 
r = gFourierInversion(N=512,K=512,dt=0.1,t0=0.05,x0=-pi/0.1,charf=StandardNormalCharf,l=par)
z = cbind((-pi/0.1+(0:511)*2*pi/(512*0.1)) , r) 
plot(z, type="l",col="blue3",lwd=2,xlab="X",ylab="Y",xlim=c(-3,3))'
