Description: 'Computes and plots the local polynomial state-price density for January 10, 1997 of Dax data (1997-2001) for tau=0.125,0.25,0.375 employing Breeden and Litzenberger (BL) method and a semi- parametric specification of the Black-Scholes option pricing function. The analytic formula of the BL method uses an estimate of the volatility smile and its first and second derivative to calculate the SPD, delta and gamma. Figures of state-price density, delta and gamma are presented for tau=0.125,0.25,0.375 with blue, black and red lines, respectively. The date can be modified to any day in the set of date=c(3,6,7,8,9,10,13,14,15,16,17, 20,21,22,23,24,27,28,29,30,31).'
