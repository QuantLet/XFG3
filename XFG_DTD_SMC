Name of QuantLet: DTD_SMC

Published in: Applied Quantitative Finance (3rd Edition)

Description: 'Shows Distance-to-Default (DTD)s using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method introduced in the paper.
There are two code files. One is RunSMC_est.m, and the other is TableGenerate.m. In RunSMC_est.m, data from "Input" folder are loaded and all other functions are stored in "subfunciton" folder. The parameters for the initialization sampler are set in funciton SMCsettingbyFirm.m. Then, we sample 1024 particles using the initialization sampler and proceed with the function SMC_Step_MixW.m, which conducts the reweighting and resampling steps. After the resampling step, a function MoveSet_MixW.m runs Metropolis-Hastings (MH) moves. At this stage, the acceptant rate of each block will be displayed in the Command Window. The SMC_Step_MixW.m function will be repeatedly run until it finishesthe likelihood density-tempering for the first 5 firms. Then, it will go back to RunSMC_est.m file. 5 firms are added each time, and re-initialization followed by calling SMC_Step_MixW.m will be conducted again and again until reaching N firms. The following files in "Examples" folder are 12 firms from Airline sector in 2014 and 40 random selected firms from Insurance sector in 2009. OutY2014_Sec20018.xlsx/ Y2014_Sec20018.mat (Time required to estimate: 0.73 hours) OutY2009_Sec20055.xlsx/ Y2009_Sec20055.mat (Time required to estimate: 13.5 hours)
In TableGenerate.m file, Table 1 to Table 4 can be generated from the "Output" data.'
